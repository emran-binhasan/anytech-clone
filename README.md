# Frontend Developer Task - Landing Page Recreation

Greetings from Emran! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this task as part of my application for the **Frontend Developer** role at **Edistys**. Below is my submission for recreating the landing page from [**Live Link**](https://anytech-clone.netlify.app)

## Overview
This project aims to replicate the landing page of **AnyTxn** using **React**. The page has been developed with smooth animations and responsiveness to ensure it performs well across various device sizes.

### Features:
- **Smooth Animations**: Elements of the page (e.g., images, text) include smooth animations similar to the original page.
- **Responsiveness**: The layout is fully responsive and adjusts seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Technologies Used:
- **React** for building the UI components.
- **CSS** for styling and animations.
- **React Router** (if applicable for routing between different sections or pages).
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations.

### Key Implementation Details:
- **Animations**: Using **Framer Motion** and CSS transitions to recreate smooth animations from the original site.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensured the layout adapts to different screen sizes using media queries and flexbox/grid systems.
